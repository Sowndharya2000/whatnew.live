      To help you get started and reward the first steps in your WhatNew journey, we’re excited to offer the <strong>New Seller Sales Match Bonus</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>
      WhatNew will match your sales up to a certain amount across the bonus period.
    </p>

    <h3>What does it mean to “match sales”?</h3>
    <p>
      Matching your sales means that for every ₹1 of item(s) you sell, WhatNew will give you an additional ₹1.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buyer purchases an item from you for ₹10 (+ shipping + taxes)</li>
      <li>WhatNew will give you an additional ₹10 to match the cost of the item you sold</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When does the bonus period start and how long is it?</h3>
    <p>
      The bonus period starts as soon as you are given selling access. In the WhatNew app, you’ll see a banner on your Home Feed showing how much time remains to earn your bonus.
    </p>

    <h3>Requirements to earn the Sales Match Bonus</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Go live for a minimum duration (e.g., 120 minutes)</li>
      <li>Sell to a specific number of different buyers (e.g., at least 5 buyers)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How much can I earn?</h3>
    <p>
      The maximum bonus amount varies by location and product type. Sellers can earn anywhere from ₹1 up to their maximum limit shown in the app.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Scenarios</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Example 1:</strong> 150 mins live , 7 buyers , ₹120 in sales → ₹120 bonus
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Example 2:</strong> 300 mins live , 20 buyers , ₹500 in sales → ₹150 bonus (max reached)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Example 3:</strong> 90 mins live , 8 buyers , ₹180 in sales → No bonus (time requirement not met)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When will I be paid?</h3>
    <p>
      Your bonus will be added to your WhatNew account balance within <strong>14 days</strong> of the end of the bonus period after all requirements are met and all qualifying orders are shipped.
    </p>

    <h3>Where will I see the payment?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>On Mobile:</strong> Seller Hub → Payouts → Transactions
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>On Desktop:</strong> Seller Hub → Financials → Ledger
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
