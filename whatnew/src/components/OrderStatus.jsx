          <h3>Check your order status on whatnew.</h3>
          <p>
            Find out if your order is being prepared, shipped and in transit, or has been delivered.
          </p>

          <h4>Check your order status in the whatnew app:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Open the whatnew app.</li>
            <li>Tap activity.</li>
            <li>From the purchases tab, find and select the purchase.</li>
            <li>The current status appears at the top of the screen.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If your order hasn’t shipped yet, the seller may still be preparing the package. 
            We ask sellers to ship within 2 business days. Learn what to do if it’s delayed.
          </p>

          <h3>Track your package with the shipping carrier</h3>
          <p>
            Once your order ships, you’ll get tracking information and can open the carrier’s tracking page from whatnew.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Tracking can take 24–48 hours to update after a label is created.</p>

          <h4>Track your package from the whatnew app:</h4>
          <ol>
         <li>Log in to whatnew.com</li>
            <li>Click the activity icon</li>
            <li>From the purchases tab, find and select the purchase</li>
            <li>Click track your purchase</li>

          <p>
            Note: Some shipping methods, like usps first-class mail, have limited tracking. 
            If you’re in the us, learn more about usps shipping timelines. 
            You can still check the order status in whatnew.
