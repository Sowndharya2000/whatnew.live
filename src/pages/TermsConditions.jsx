      Your use of the Tips feature, and your payment or receipt of tips on WhatNew, are subject 
      to the following Tips Terms and Conditions, under which the Tips feature is made available.

      shipment of a tangible item or the receipt by buyers of an Item (each as defined in the Terms) 
      to complete the Transaction.
