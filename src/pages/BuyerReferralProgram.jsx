          The WhatNew Buyer Referral Program allows you to give your friends or social media following
          free money to spend towards their first purchase on WhatNew and earn credit for yourself when
          they use that credit to make a purchase.
        </p>

        <p>Please note, there is a separate Seller Referral Program.</p>

        <h3>What do I get for referring buyers to WhatNew?</h3>
        <p>
          Referral credit bonuses vary by buyer/seller status and country. Sellers can offer a higher
          referral credit amount to buyers, and every referral automatically follows their account for
          7 days. Visit the referral hub in the app for your specific offer details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Referral credit has no minimum spend and can be used in shows and on the WhatNew marketplace.
          Credit cannot currently be applied to offers, auctions, taxes, or shipping.
