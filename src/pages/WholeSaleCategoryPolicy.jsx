    <p>
      <strong>WhatNew’s Wholesale Category</strong> is designed to support high volume transactions and reseller product sourcing, which includes the sale of entire pallets, casepacks, and bundled inventory. Given the nature of these transactions, WhatNew has implemented specific policies to promote transparency, consistency, and trust between sellers and buyers.
    </p>

      <li>Seller Requirements – Wholesale Category </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is sold in the Wholesale category </h3>
    <p>In the Wholesale Category, there are two subcategories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pallets</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Casepacks & Bundles</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Selling in the Pallets Subcategory</h3>
    <p>
      A pallet is a bulk collection of items in wholesale quantities (typically 100+ items). Pallet inventory can be wholesale (direct from manufacturer/distributor) or liquidation inventory (e.g., overstock, returned, or past-season stock). Pallets will ship via Freight through our external partner <strong>Blue Grace</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Selling in Casepacks & Bundles Subcategory</h3>
    <p>
      Casepacks & bundles are lots of 10+ units intended for resale. Typically, casepacks are made up of multiples of the same item, while bundles are mixed inventory. These lots are organized in a box and shipped via standard WhatNew shipping labels.
    </p>

    <h3>Buyers in Wholesale Category</h3>
    <p>
      Buyers should carefully review the seller’s manifest (as applicable), listing details, and ask relevant questions to understand what they’re buying (e.g., direct from manufacturer vs liquidation) and the condition of items.
    </p>

    <h4>Buyer Shipping Considerations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pallets:</strong> Sellers must ship within 3 business days. Freight carriers will contact buyers within 3 business days. Average delivery is 1–3 weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Casepacks & Bundles:</strong> Must be shipped within 2 business days, following WhatNew’s general shipping policy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Buyer phone number:</strong> Shared with seller for coordinating pallet delivery with freight carrier.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Seller Requirements – Wholesale Category (US)</h3>
