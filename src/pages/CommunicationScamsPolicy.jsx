    <h3>How to Identify Scams</h3>
    <p>To help you avoid scams, we have set out some guidance and example scams below.</p>

    <h4>1. Impersonation of WhatNew Representatives</h4>
    <p>
      Scammers may pretend to be representatives of WhatNew. Please be cautious when receiving suspicious DMs or emails from someone claiming to be a WhatNew representative.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>All WhatNew emails come from the <strong>@whatNew.com</strong> domain.</li>
      <li>
        Examples of official WhatNew email addresses include:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="mailto:sellersupport@WhatNew.com">sellersupport@WhatNew.com</a></li>
          <li><a href="mailto:trustandsafety@WhatNew.com">trustandsafety@WhatNew.com</a></li>
        
        </ul>
      </li>
     
      <li>WhatNew will <strong>NEVER</strong> ask for your payment details via email.</li>
      <li>WhatNew will <strong>NEVER</strong> request prepaid cards or ask you to activate “Instant Payouts.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Fake Buyer or Seller Messages</h4>
    <p>
      Scammers may pretend to have information from WhatNew representatives. 
      A scammer may pose as a buyer claiming that WhatNew contacted them asking for you to take an action (like updating payment details). 
      WhatNew will always contact you directly if you need to update your account.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Romance or Relationship Scams</h4>
    <p>
      Scammers may try to build a relationship or romantic connection over DM, then later request money or information. 
      These scams may continue for weeks or months before the scammer makes a request.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Be cautious when communicating with users who seek romantic connections then ask for money.</li>
      <li>Do not share personal or banking information over DM.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Giveaway Scams</h4>
    <p>
      Scammers may message users saying they’ve “won a free item” and request shipping or customs fees to receive it.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be careful of messages asking you to pay advance fees for “free” items.</li>
      <li>Do not share personal or payment information over DM.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Impersonating Buyers in Livestreams</h4>
    <p>
      Some scammers impersonate buyers after the real buyer leaves a livestream, using similar usernames and profile pictures.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sellers should always confirm they are shipping to the original buyer.</li>
      <li>Never open sealed products or send items to anyone other than the verified buyer.</li>
      <li>All sales must occur through the WhatNew livestream or marketplace — never via DMs.</li>
    </ul>
